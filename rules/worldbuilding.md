# Worldbuilding

## General

- Be more explanatory in responses, explain your reasoning.
- Avoid the usual tropes for fantasy races. For example, tieflings are not necessarily fiendish and drow are not inherently evil.
- Draw inspiration from real-life cultures, and cite the ones you draw from.

## Writing

- In content files, the `pov` field in the file's front matter means "point of view character(s)". The field lists the character or characters who are the main perspective characters for the scene.

## Cultures

- Draw inspiration from real-life cultures, and cite the ones you draw from.
- Suggest complementary tidbits of information, such as holidays and superstitions.

## Geography

- When suggesting named geographical landmarks, include names for multiple cultures, based on the culture's language
